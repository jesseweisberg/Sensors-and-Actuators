# Sensors-and-Actuators
A mini wearable device project implemented with Raspberry Pi that integrates a number of sensors and actuators to track simple biometrics such as pulse and body temperature. Actuators can either alert the user (red blinking LED) or cool him/her down (actuate a 'fan' with a DC motor) if overheating occurs.  A green LED light blinks with every pulse.
